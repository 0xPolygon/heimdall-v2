# Containerized Migration

As a prerequisite, make sure you have all the prerequisites in place, as described in [Migration Checklist](../containerized/1-MIGRATION-CHECKLIST.md).  
If you are using a containerized version of Heimdall (e.g. `docker` or inside a `kubernetes` cluster),
an image will be available to pull once the pilot node migration is successful.
You'd need to back up the content of v1 `HEIMDALL_HOME` folder, for future reference,
Then, pull and install the v2 docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/0xpolygon/heimdall-v2/tags
```bash
docker pull 0xpolygon/heimdall-v2:<VERSION>
```
Where `VERSION` is for example `0.2.4`

# TODO remove the following step once configs are embedded in the image
Now install the default configs for Heimdall v2 by running the following command:
```bash
  heimdalld init <MONIKER> --chain-id <CHAIN_ID>
```
Where `MONIKER` is the name of your node (any string) and `CHAIN_ID` is the chain you are running Heimdall-v2 on
(e.g., `heimdallv2-80002` for `amoy`, and `heimdallv2-137` for `mainnet`)

Then apply your custom configuration to the `app.toml`, `config.toml` and `client.toml` files.
Then, you can customize the configs under `HEIMDALL_HOME/config` (`app.toml`, `client.toml`, `config.toml`),
based on your setup.
Templates for each supported network are available [here](https://github.com/0xPolygon/heimdall-v2/tree/develop/packaging/templates/config)

Now, download the `genesis.json` file from the GCP bucket URL.  
The URL is [this for mainnet](https://storage.googleapis.com/mainnet-heimdallv2-genesis/migrated_dump-genesis.json),  
and [this for amoy](https://storage.googleapis.com/amoy-heimdallv2-genesis/migrated_dump-genesis.json).
Mainnet one will be available once the pilot node migration is successful.  
Name such genesis file `genesis.json` and place it in the `HEIMDALL_HOME/config` directory.

The file is going to be pretty large, especially for mainnet, where it is expected to be around 4â€“5 GB.
Hence, please make sure you have enough disk space available, and you have a fast internet connection.
At this point, you can run the heimdall-v2 image, with a command like the following:
```bash
docker run -d --name heimdall-v2 \
  -v "$HEIMDALL_HOME:/var/lib/heimdall \
  -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 \
  0xpolygon/heimdall-v2:<VERSION> \
  start
```
Make sure to customize the flags based on your setup.
