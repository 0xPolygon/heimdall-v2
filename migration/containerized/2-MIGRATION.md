# Containerized Migration

As a prerequisite, make sure you have all the prerequisites in place, as described in [Migration Checklist](../containerized/1-MIGRATION-CHECKLIST.md).  
If you are using a containerized version of Heimdall (e.g. `docker` or inside a `kubernetes` cluster),
an image will be available to pull once the pilot node migration is successful.
You'd need to back up the content of v1 `HEIMDALL_HOME` folder, for future reference,
Then, pull and install the v2 docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/0xpolygon/heimdall-v2/tags
```bash
docker pull 0xpolygon/heimdall-v2:<VERSION>
```
# TODO remove this step if confirmed that the image will come with the default configs
Now install the default configs for Heimdall v2 by running the following command:
```bash
  heimdalld init <MONIKER> --chain-id <CHAIN_ID>
```
`<MONIKER>` is the name of your node and `<CHAIN_ID>` is the chain you are running Heimdall-v2 on
(e.g., `heimdallv2-80002` for `amoy`, and `heimdallv2-137` for `mainnet`)

Then apply your custom configuration to the `app.toml`, `config.toml` and `client.toml` files.
Now, download the `genesis.json` file from the GCP bucket URL (https://storage.googleapis.com/mainnet-heimdallv2-genesis/migrated_dump-genesis.json),
which will be available once the pilot node migration is successful,  
and place it in the `HEIMDALL_HOME/config` directory.

The file is going to be pretty large, especially for mainnet, where it is expected to be around 4â€“5 GB.
Hence, please make sure you have enough disk space available, and you have a fast internet connection.
At this point, you can run the heimdall-v2 image.
