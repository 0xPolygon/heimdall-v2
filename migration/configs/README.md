# Info

In this folder, you can find some example configuration files for bor, heimdall-v1 and heimdall-v2.
All the changes required for v1>v2 migration are marked with a `TODO-MIGRATION`.  
Such `TODO`s only mention what is not needed; all the rest can be ported over to v2.  
Migration script will handle this automatically.
